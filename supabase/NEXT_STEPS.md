# Next Steps - Action Required

## You Have Two Options

### Option A: Apply the SQL Fix (Recommended)

If you have access to Supabase Dashboard:

1. Open <https://app.supabase.com>
2. Select your Isotek project  
3. Click SQL Editor → New Query
4. Copy ALL contents from: `supabase/fix_company_profiles_relationship.sql`
5. Paste and click Run
6. Report back the results

**This takes 2-3 minutes and permanently fixes the issue.**

### Option B: Use Alternative Code Fix (Temporary Workaround)

If you cannot access Supabase right now, I can modify the code to work without the foreign key relationship. This is less efficient but will let you continue working.

**This is a temporary workaround - you should still apply Option A later.**

## Please Choose

Reply with:

- **"A"** - I'll apply the SQL fix in Supabase now
- **"B"** - Give me the code workaround instead
- **"Already done"** - I already ran the SQL script
- **"Error: [message]"** - I tried but got an error

I'm waiting for your response to proceed!
